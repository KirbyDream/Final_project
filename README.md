# Music business landscape analysis
## Selma Laarabi



## Introduction
Music is the common language of the world, and just like any other form of communication it evolves alongside our needs.
In this project we are going on a journey to explore how our listening habit evolved overtime, and how much of a market music represents.
For this project, I had to collect data from multiple sources:     
   * The kaggle data repository    
   * Web scraping from different websites   
   * Public APIs   
   * Different articles on the internet 
  
After extracting this raw data, I have used Jupyter notebooks to process it, transform it and make it ready for loading and analysis.
I have stored my processed data into a Mysql database and various CSV files and for visualisation I have used Tableau.
